# Platform Independence Explanation

## Why you see "replit.dev" in the callback URL

The `replit.dev` domain appears in the callback URL because that's where your app is currently running for development. This is NOT a dependency - it's just the current hosting environment.

## How it works on different platforms:

### Current (Development on Replit):
```
https://a5c567a0-174b-47db-9d57-5e33365b5c4e-00-1fsioh8r1zwfp.janeway.replit.dev/api/auth/google/callback
```

### On Heroku:
```
https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/api/auth/google/callback
```

### On Vercel:
```
https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/auth/google/callback
```

### On your own domain:
```
https://clubify.yourdomain.com/api/auth/google/callback
```

## The app is completely platform-independent:

1. **No Replit-specific code**: All dependencies removed
2. **Environment variable driven**: Uses `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` env var
3. **Standard Node.js patterns**: Works anywhere Node.js runs
4. **No vendor lock-in**: Can be deployed to any hosting service

## When you deploy elsewhere:

1. Set `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable to your new domain
2. Update Google OAuth settings with the new callback URL
3. Deploy - no code changes needed

The app detects the current domain automatically, but you can override it with environment variables for any hosting platform.
